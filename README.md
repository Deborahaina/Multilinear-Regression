# Multilinear-Regression
In this project, we train a shallow model using a kaggle competition dataset. In this competition, Kaggle is challenging you to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Your primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

The competition dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this playground competition. Based on individual trip attributes, participants should predict the duration of each trip in the test set.
The dataset is used here is solely for educational purposes and non-commercial purposes.

Using the sklearn linear model package, I was able to preprocess, clean, tune hyperparameters to come up with the best model, provided it is not the best score. You can use the same process for other dataset, of course bearing in mind that you may have to do some feature enginerring if necessary and some hyperparameter tuning as well.
